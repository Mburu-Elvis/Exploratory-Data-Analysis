    "it's a statistical measure that quantifies the relationship betweeen two random variables.\n",
    "It provides information about how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable\n",
    "It measures the directional relationship between the return values on two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can take any value between -infinity to  +infinity\n",
    ">>- -ve represents a negative relationship (inverse), +ve represents the positive relationship\n",
    "- it's used for the linear relationship between variable\n",
    "- it gives the direction of the relationship between variable\n",
    "Covariance of zero indicats there's no clear dirctional relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's calculated by analyzing standard deviations from the expected return/ measuring the correlation between two random variables by the standard deviation of each variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "***it does not indicate the degree to which the two variables being measured move in relation to one another***\n",
